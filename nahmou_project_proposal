## Introduction
Glaucoma remains the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, a neurodegenerative pathology characterized by the progressive death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the degeneration of the optic nerve (Tham et al. 2014). While the primary risk factor is elevated intraocular pressure, the biological cascade, including changes in gene regulation, leading to blindness is complex, involving interactions between neurons and neighboring glial cells—astrocytes, Müller glia, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in addition to vascular and immune cells (Liddelow et al. 2017). While previous studies have documented morphological and transcriptomic changes in murine models, human tissue studies of glaucomatous tissues are limited to histology and bulk gene expression (Monavarfeshani et al. 2023) To date, no comprehensive study has fully characterized the transcriptomic shifts in human glaucomatous tissue at the single-cell resolution. This project proposes to bridge that gap by analyzing single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from postmortem human tissue. By leveraging advanced bioinformatics pipelines, this project will identify cell-type-specific responses in late-stage glaucoma, offering a feasible yet high-impact investigation into the molecular drivers of human neurodegeneration.
## Data and Questions
This study is designed to address the following questions: which cell types are changing transcriptomically in human glaucoma and how are they changing? The dataset for this project is derived from the 10X Genomics platform, a gold-standard technology for droplet-based single-cell capture (Zheng et al. 2017). Specifically, I will analyze raw sequencing data obtained from postmortem human tissue samples comprising four donors with confirmed late-stage glaucoma and four age-matched healthy controls. The tissue samples encompass both the optic nerve head, the critical site of mechanical insult, and the optic nerve proper. The choice of single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) over standard single-cell RNA-seq is particularly advantageous for this study design. In frozen postmortem human neuronal tissue, cell integrity is often compromised, making the isolation of intact cells difficult. In contrast, nuclei remain robust, ensuring high-quality data recovery (Habib et al, 2017). 
The core of this analysis will be performed using Seurat, the industry-standard R toolkit for single-cell transcriptomic analysis (Hao et al. 2021). The first and most critical step to ensure feasibility is rigorous quality control assessed by visualizing the distribution of Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) and gene counts to identify and remove empty droplets, i.e. background noise, and doublets, or cell clumps. Furthermore, I will adjust the threshold for mitochondrial read fractions since a high mitochondrial percentage typically indicates cell death, a threshold that is higher in neurons because of their increased mitochondrial density (Osorio et al. 2021).
Since these samples come from eight distinct human donors, technical batch effects are expected. I will utilize Seurat’s integration functions to merge the datasets together, ensuring that cells cluster based on biological identity (e.g., astrocyte vs. microglia) rather than donor identity (Stuart et al. 2019). Once integrated, the high-dimensional gene expression data will be compressed into a two-dimensional UMAP visualization. Clusters will be annotated using canonical marker genes (e.g., _Rbpms_ for RGCs, _Gfap_ for astrocytes) to generate a comprehensive cell atlas of the glaucomatous optic nerve. 
Beyond simply cataloging cell types, this project asks: How do these cells behave differently in disease? To answer this, I will perform Differential Expression Analysis (DEA) to identify genes upregulated in glaucoma. These gene lists will be fed into clusterProfiler (Wu et al. 2021) to perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Finally, to address the hypothesis that glial cells actively contribute to RGC death, I will employ CellChat to model cell-cell communication (Jin et al. 2021). By analyzing the expression of ligand-receptor pairs, CellChat can infer the probability of intercellular signaling. This will enable me to visualize the communication network of the optic nerve and nerve head to determine, for example, if glaucomatous astrocytes are secreting neurotoxic signals (like _Lcn2_ or _TNFa_) that are received by receptors on the RGCs.
## Conclusion
This project utilizes high-quality, pre-existing single-nucleus sequencing data to investigate the cellular underpinnings of human glaucoma. By applying a standard yet robust bioinformatics workflow including quality control in Seurat to advanced pathway modeling with clusterProfiler and CellChat, this proposal outlines a clear and achievable path to uncovering novel biological insights. The resulting analysis will not only serve as a comprehensive application of the skills learned in this course but by the end of this project, I will have produced a cell-type-resolved atlas of transcriptomic changes in human glaucoma and identified candidate pathways for further study.
