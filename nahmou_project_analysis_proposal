# EE282 Project Analysis Proposal
## Introduction
The cellular and molecular changes in human glaucoma are important but incompletely understood. This proposal applies the 10X Genomics platform for single nucleus sequencing of primary human donor optic nerve head tissue, a critical site in glaucomatous damage, derived from glaucomatous or healthy age-matched controls. In order to draw conclusions about the underlying biological mechanisms, these data will require careful bioinformatic analysis in several steps: 
## Quality Control
Raw sequencing data will be verified for data integrity and quality control to ensure all included data meets expected standards. First, *FastQC* will be run to verify sequencing reads are reliable. Next, the *md5sum* will be performed for all downloaded sequencing files to ensure they are unique and map to the md5sun signatures provided by the sequencing vendor. Then, files will be run through the CellRanger pipeline which computes the number of unique molecules, i.e. transcripts, as well as identifies the number of barcoded droplets to derive the numbers of reads, cells captured, and genes per cell. Additionally information on mitochondrial gene number and ambient RNA can be obtained to exclude low quality samples that were indicative of dying cells and damaged nuclei
## Basic analysis: Clustering and cell type annotation
Next, the high-dimensional data must be reduced to visualize cell clusters by uniform manifold approximation projection (UMAP) as well as confirm samples can be segregated by principal component analysis (PCA). Once clusters are annotated based on expected cell type markers, the relative abundance of different cell types can be 
## In-depth analysis: Differential gene expression (DEG) and pathway analysis
